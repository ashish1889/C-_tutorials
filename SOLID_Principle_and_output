Which SOLID principle is violated here:
#include <iostream>
class Rectangle{
    protected:
        int h;
        int w;
    public:
    virtual void setHeight(int i){
        h = i;
    }
    
    virtual void setWidtht(int i){
        w = i;
    }

    virtual int getHeight(){
        return h;
    }

    virtual int getWidth(){
        return w;
    }
};

class Square : public Rectangle{
    public:
    virtual void setHeight(int i){
        h = i;
        w = i;
    }
    
    virtual void setWidtht(int i){
        w = i;
        h = i;
    }

    virtual int getHeight(){
        return h;
    }

    virtual int getWidth(){
        return w;
    }
};

int main() {
    
    std::cout << "Hello LeetCoder";
}

Solution:

The code violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).

Explanation:

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without 
affecting the correctness of the program.
In this code, Square is a subclass of Rectangle.
However, the behavior of Square's setWidtht and setHeight methods differs from that of Rectangle.
In Rectangle, setHeight and setWidtht allow setting the height and width independently.
In Square, these methods violate the principle by setting both height and width to the same value, which contradicts the behavior expected from a rectangle.
This violates the LSP because Square is not a proper subtype of Rectangle. Substituting a Square for a Rectangle may lead to unexpected behavior in 
applications that rely on the independent setting of width and height.
Therefore, this code violates the Liskov Substitution Principle.


Solution to improve this code:

To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), we need to ensure that the behavior of the derived class (Square) does not contradict 
the behavior expected from its base class (Rectangle). In the case of a square and a rectangle, a square is a special case of a rectangle where 
all sides are equal.

Here's a revised version of the code to adhere to LSP:

#include <iostream>

class Rectangle {
protected:
    int height;
    int width;
public:
    virtual void setHeight(int h) {
        height = h;
    }
    
    virtual void setWidth(int w) {
        width = w;
    }

    int getHeight() const {
        return height;
    }

    int getWidth() const {
        return width;
    }
    
    int getArea() const {
        return height * width;
    }
};

class Square : public Rectangle {
public:
    virtual void setHeight(int side) override {
        height = side;
        width = side;
    }
    
    virtual void setWidth(int side) override {
        height = side;
        width = side;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle rect;
    rect.setHeight(5);
    rect.setWidth(10);
    std::cout << "Rectangle Area: " << rect.getArea() << std::endl;
    
    Square square;
    square.setHeight(5);
    std::cout << "Square Area: " << square.getArea() << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}


Changes made:

The height and width members of the base class Rectangle are made protected instead of private to allow access to derived classes.
setHeight and setWidth methods are overridden in the Square class to ensure that when setting the side of a square, both height and width
are set to the same value.
Added a method getArea in the Rectangle class to calculate the area, which can be used by both Rectangle and Square.
Removed unnecessary virtual keyword in getWidth and getHeight methods since they are not overridden in derived classes.
In main, demonstrated the usage of both Rectangle and Square classes to show the correctness of area calculations for both shapes.

Problem/Output in below:
#include <stdio.h>
#include<iostream>

#include <memory>

class A{
    int a;
    public:
        int getVal(){
            return a;
        }
        void setVal(int i){
            a = i;
        }
};

void func1(std::shared_ptr<A>& a){
    int i = a->getVal();  //a.getVal(); 
    std::cout<<"func1 integer = "<<i<<std::endl;
}

void func2(A* a){
    int i = a->getVal();
    std::cout<<"func2 integer = "<<i<<std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<A> spa = std::make_shared<A>();
    func1(spa);
    func2(spa.get());
    return 0;
}

The given code compiles and runs without any syntactical or logical errors. 
However, there is a potential problem related to memory management in the function func2.

In the main function, a std::shared_ptr<A> named spa is created to manage the memory of the A object. 
This shared pointer is then passed to both func1 and func2.

In func1, the shared pointer is passed by reference and accessed through the arrow operator (->). 
This is correct usage of std::shared_ptr.

In func2, however, the raw pointer is obtained from the shared pointer using the get() function. 
While this is allowed, it's important to note that using raw pointers obtained from smart pointers can lead to potential issues if not used carefully:

Lifetime Management: When you pass a raw pointer (A*) obtained from a std::shared_ptr, you lose the safety net provided by smart pointers. 
If the shared pointer goes out of scope or gets reset while a raw pointer is still in use, it could lead to a dangling pointer issue.

Ownership Semantics: Using a raw pointer doesn't convey ownership semantics. 
Other parts of the code might assume ownership or perform memory management operations, leading to confusion or memory leaks.

To mitigate these issues, it's generally better to use smart pointers consistently throughout the codebase. 
If func2 doesn't need shared ownership of the A object, you can pass it a const reference to avoid potential misuse:

void func2(const A& a) {
    int i = a.getVal();
    std::cout << "func2 integer = " << i << std::endl;
}

By passing A by const reference, you can ensure that the function func2 safely accesses the object without taking ownership or affecting its lifetime.
